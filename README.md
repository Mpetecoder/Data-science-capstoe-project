Analyzing Social Media User Interaction

Project Overview

This project explores the use of machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze social media interactions. The goal is to collect social media data (e.g., Twitter), apply basic NLP techniques, and visualize insights into user engagement and sentiment. The project will explore ways to classify and cluster posts based on content, sentiment, and interactions.

Data Source

The Sentiment140 dataset from Kaggle includes tweets labeled with sentiments (negative, neutral, and positive). This dataset will serve as a starting point for the analysis, but additional data from social media platforms like Twitter may also be collected through APIs.

Tools and Techniques

Data Collection: Twitter API or other social media APIs

Text Analysis: spaCy, NLTK

Visualization: matplotlib, Plotly

Why It Matters

This matters because millions of people use social media, and I want to understand the effects of our constant use on our behaviors. I’m not fully sure what topic I want to explore yet, but I do know I’m going to explore the data and see what it tells me.
